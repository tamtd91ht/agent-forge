# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- `agent-forge forge PATH`: one-shot scan → upgrade managed → add recommended → diff →
  single confirmation → approve + apply → validate. `--dry-run`, `--show-diff`,
  `--shared-files`, `--yes`, `--json`.

### Changed
- Matching evaluates applicability *before* runtime requirements, so native capabilities
  (REA, full UI UX Pro Max toolkit) are hinted only for projects they fit; a backend-only
  project no longer sees UI/UX runtime suggestions.
- `.gitattributes` forces LF so registry digests and managed-file hashes match across OSes.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-16

Initial release (built from the Agent Forge master prompt).

### Added
- Python package `agent_forge` with Typer CLI: `init`, `sources list|clone|sync`,
  `catalog [show]`, `scan`, `assign`, `upgrade`, `plans`, `diff`, `approve`, `apply`,
  `validate`, `status`, `rollback`, `reindex`; stable exit codes and `--json` output.
- Capability registry model (Pydantic, `extra=forbid`) with exported JSON Schemas; lifecycle
  states; install strategies `file_copy`, `section_merge`, `native_plugin`, `reference_only`.
- Source manager for approved git repositories (clone, status, fetch/compare, explicit
  update) and provenance verification against pinned commit SHAs.
- Read-only scanner: bounded walker that never follows symlinks or Windows junctions, skips
  secret-looking files, evidence-based language/framework/project-type detection, agent
  inventory for Claude Code and Codex, managed-manifest validation with drift detection.
- Deterministic matching engine (hard rules → scoring) with equivalence detection,
  destination-collision and declared-conflict handling, dependency pull-in, explanations.
- Planner producing hash-bound file operations and unified diffs; approval bound to the
  plan digest; shared-file operations require `approve --shared-files`.
- Transactional apply with backups, atomic writes, read-back verification and sealed
  transaction records; conflict-aware rollback (strict, `--partial`, section-aware).
- Validation of registry, provenance, managed installs, config syntax, duplicates and
  transaction integrity.
- Adapters for Claude Code (skills, rules, agents, CLAUDE.md sections) and OpenAI Codex
  (skills, AGENTS.md sections), conventions verified on 2026-10-16.
- Initial curated catalog: 10 from ECC, 2 from UI UX Pro Max, 1 from REA, 1 workspace-authored.
- Test suite (unit, security incl. hypothesis fuzzing and junction tests, integration, e2e).
- Documentation set under `docs/`, ADR-0001, discovery report, workspace status.
